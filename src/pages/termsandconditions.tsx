                    As spelled out in our Privacy Policy, personal and account
                    information will never be disclosed to third parties under
                    any circumstances other than to respond to subpoenas, court

                    Once a secret has been received by a recipient, we have no
                    way of retrieving said secret again, nor do we log or keep
                    any data that tracks the sender or receiver&apos;s IP
                    address beyond 14 days. Necessary data that attaches the
                    contents of a secret to a user account is kept only until
                    the secret is received, at which point it is destroyed
