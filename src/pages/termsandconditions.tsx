                User accounts have fixed limits in order that we can provide a
                well functioning service for all users. We can disable your
                account should there be any attempt to use the service in a way
                that we deem to be unreasonable and that affects the usage of
                the service by others. What consists of 'reasonable use' is
                completely at our discretion and your account may be disbled
                without prior notice if your usage is disruptive and if deemed
                necessary to restore a quality of service.

                </Heading>
                <br />
                As spelled out in our Privacy Policy, personal and account
                information will never be disclosed to third parties under any
                circumstances other than to respond to subpoenas, court orders,
                or other legal process, as required by law, or to establish or
                exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We
                will never sell or share any of this data.
                <br />
                <br />
                Once a secret has been received by a recipient, we have no way
                of retrieving said secret again, nor do we log or keep any data
                that tracks the sender or receiver's IP address beyond 14 days.
                Necessary data that attaches the contents of a secret to a user
                account is kept only until the secret is received, at which
                point it is destroyed permanently. 3. Licence, Restrictions and
                Prohibited Acts

                applicable laws. You may not sublicense, assign, or transfer the
                licence granted to you under the Terms of Use, and any attempt
                to sublicense, assign, or transfer any part of your rights under
                the Terms of Use is void. <br />
