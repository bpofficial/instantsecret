                    We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy
                    describes our practices regarding personal and account
                    information collected through our website.

                    <br />
                    We will periodically review the appropriateness of this
                    privacy policy and may make, in our discretion, such changes
                    as are necessary. If we decide to change this privacy
                    policy, we will post those changes here so that you will
                    always know what information we gather, how we might use
                    that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
                    You should visit our website periodically to review any
                    changes.

                    We feel that this tool is definitely safer than using email
                    or chat tools to send private information. However, if you
                    are concerned that any third party (ie. us) holding this
                    data is a risk, then you should consider either encrypting
                    the data first and passing the credentials for this one-time
                    via another means, or use something else altogether (GnuPG
                    is a good candidate).
